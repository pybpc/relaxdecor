``walrus`` - Backport Compiler for Assignment Expressions
=========================================================

   Write *assignment expressions* in Python 3.8 flavour, and let ``walrus`` worry about back-port issues |:beer:|

Since :pep:`572`, Python introduced *assignment expressions* syntax in version **3.8**. For those who wish to use
*assignment expressions* in their code, ``walrus`` provides an intelligent, yet imperfect, solution of a
**backport compiler** by replacing *assignment expressions* syntax with old-fashioned syntax, which guarantees
you to always write *assignment expressions* in Python 3.8 flavour then compile for compatibility later.

Installation
------------

.. warning::

   ``walrus`` is currently under reconstruction. It is highly recommended to directly 
   install from the git repo or the pre-release distributions.

.. note::

   ``walrus`` only supports Python versions **since 3.4** |:snake:|

For macOS users, ``walrus`` is available through `Homebrew`_:

.. code-block:: shell

   brew tap jarryshaw/tap
   brew install walrus
   # or simply, a one-liner
   brew install jarryshaw/tap/walrus

You can also install from `PyPI`_ for any OS:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install bpc-walrus

Or install the latest version from the `Git repository`_:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/pybpc/walrus.git
   cd walrus
   pip install -e .
   # and to update at any time
   git pull

.. note::
   Installation from `Homebrew`_ will also automatically install the man page and
   `Bash Completion`_ script for you. If you are installing from `PyPI`_ or
   the `Git repository`_, you can install the completion script manually.
